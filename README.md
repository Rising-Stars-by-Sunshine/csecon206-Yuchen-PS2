- **Author**: Yuchen Song, Computation and Design with tracks in Computer Science, Class of 2025, Duke Kunshan University
- **Instructor**: Prof. Luyao Zhang, Duke Kunshan University
- **Disclaimer**: Submissions to the Problem Set No.2 for [COMPSCI/ECON 206 Computational Microeconomics, 2023 Spring (Seven Week - Second)](https://ce.pubpub.org/) instructed by Prof. Luyao Zhang at Duke Kunshan University.
- **Acknowledgments**: [How to Acknowledge?](https://www.scribbr.co.uk/thesis-dissertation/acknowledgements/)
[notes: please include all professors, students, and staff who have contributed to your completetion of the project.]
- **Project Summary**: 
  - General introduction of Game Theory: In the Overleaf.zip file, some concepts including history of Game Theory, some important formula of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, and some glossaries are introduced.
  - Game simulation: In the Code generated from Google Colab, two games with the type of normal/strategic form matrix & extensive form are simulated by Python package Nashpy and Game Theory Explorer respectively.
  
   
Note: please insert the screenshot of the answers to your research question by ChatGPT. The methodology that you use to address the research questions must be more innovative than both the current literature and ChatGPT.
